# Instructions for writing a test:
#
# t: initializes new test
# n: initializes bit array
# r: rotates bit array subset at offset, length by amount
# e: expects raw bit array value

# Ex:
# t 0
# 
# n 10010110
# r 0 8 -1
# e 00101101

# Rotate 1 left
t 1
n 1001 
r 0 4 -1
e 0011

# Rotate 1 right
t 2
n 1001 
r 0 4 1
e 1100

# Rotate 5 left; equivalent to 1 left
t 3
n 1001
r 0 4 -5
e 0011

# Rotate 5 right; equivalent to 1 right
t 4
n 1001
r 0 4 5
e 1100

# 1 bit
# all 1 bit
t 6
n 111
r 0 3 1
e 111
